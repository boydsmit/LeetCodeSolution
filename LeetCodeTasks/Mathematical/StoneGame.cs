     * TASK: 877
     *
     * Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each
     * pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].
     *
     * The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.
     *
     * Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from
     * either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point
     * the person with the most stones wins.
     *
     * Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.
